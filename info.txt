I find my fitness activities under-represented in step counter documents, so I want to create my own conversions
by creating mathematical relationships between MY activities and the other, more well-documented activities.

First of all burpees.
I do burpees at approximately 10 per minute, which is quite high exertion, probably on par with the following
activities from this source: https://www.pehp.org/mango/pdf/pehp/pdc/step%20conversion%20chart_FFB805BB.pdf
Bicycling, 15 mph vigorous: 222 steps/minute
Rowing machine, vigourous: 189 steps/minute
10 minute mile: 222 steps/minute
Fitness class - high impact: 212 steps/minute
Average: 211 steps per minute of burpess at 10 burpees per minute pace
But let's DO 21.1 steps per burpee and just assume I'm always doing them at that rate and use the NUMBER of burpees as the input.


Second of all yoga. Most source categorize yoga as a low-steps activity down there with other slow-paced,
easy exercises. This is not correct. Yoga is nuanced and can be extremely difficult, even as difficult as
burpees if you want it to be depending on which poses you're doing, how often and quickly you transition
between poses, etc. So I am going to make three categories of yoga here related to how similar they are
to other activities that are more well documented:
Vigorous yoga: 200 steps / minute
Intermediate yoga: 150 steps / minute
Relaxing yoga: 100 steps / minute
